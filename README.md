React Quiz App üß†
This is a dynamic and interactive quiz application built with React. It's designed to be a simple, fun, and educational tool for testing general knowledge. The app fetches questions from an external API, provides a clean user interface, and tracks your score and high scores.

‚ú® Features
Multiple Difficulties: Choose between easy, medium, and hard questions.

Dynamic Questions: Fetches 10 general knowledge questions from the Open Trivia Database API.

Answer Review: After completing the quiz, you can review all your answers to see what you got right and wrong.

High Score Tracking: The app saves your highest score to local storage so you can try to beat it on your next attempt.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the UI looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Session Management: The app saves your progress to session storage, so you don't lose your place if you accidentally refresh the page.
